### Key Features

- **Smart Contract Support**: Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility allows development in Solidity. This allows for seamless integration with the existing Ethereum ecosystem.
- **P2P Communication**: Real-time peer-to-peer communication using WebRTC. Data transfer between nodes is fast and secure, optimizing the performance of distributed applications.
- **Scalability**: Advanced scalability features with sharding and DAG ensure consistent high performance even as the network grows.

### Usage scenarios

- **Financial Transactions**: Fast and secure transaction processing enables instant settlement and asset management.
- **Supply Chain Management**: Transparent and reliable transactions with real-time tracking.
- **Decentralized Applications**: Enhance user experience with fast P2P communication and smart contracts.

### Why is this feasible?

HyperFlux is able to achieve these goals because of the following innovations: 1.

1. **Proprietary BFT + DAG Algorithm**: enables rapid processing and finalization of transactions and high throughput [ [oai_citation:1,GitHub - Setheum-Labs/Setheum: Setheum: zk-SNARKs Enabled DAG Powered Blockchain for Light-speed Smart Contracts. Ready for hacking ](https://github.com/Setheum-Labs/Setheum) [oai_citation:2,SNARKtor : A Decentralized Protocol for Scaling SNARKs Verification in Blockchains | Telos Blockchain | World's Fastest EVM](https://www.telos.net/post/ snarktor-a-decentralized-protocol-for-scaling-snarks-verification-in-blockchains)
2. **zk-SNARKs technology**: provides a trusted blockchain environment with enhanced data privacy and security [ [oai_citation:3,Zero-knowledge rollups | ethereum.org](https:// ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/)
3. **Sharding technology**: effectively distributes network load and improves scalability [ [oai_citation:4,The Convergence of Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Decentralized Systems: Part 2 | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/the-convergence-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-and-decentralized-systems-part-2/) [oai_citation:5,ZkEVM explained: examining the future of zk rollups - LimeChain](https://limechain.tech/blog/zkevm-explained-the-future-of-zk-rollups/)
4. **EVM compatibility**: compatibility with the existing Ethereum ecosystem makes it easier for developers to use existing tools and libraries [ [oai_citation:6,The Sudden Rise of EVM-Compatible ZK Rollups](https ://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/20/the-sudden-rise-of-evm-compatible-zk-rollups/)
5. **Using Autonomous Development Software**: The advent of autonomous development software such as OpenDevin has greatly increased the efficiency of the development process and enabled the implementation of advanced technologies.

### Why this has not been the case until now.

Traditional blockchain projects have faced the so-called “trilemma” of scalability, security, and decentralization. Many projects focused on some of these elements, making it very difficult to achieve all of them simultaneously. For example, combining EVM compatibility with zk-SNARKs was technically very complex and required a lot of resources and time [ [oai_citation:7,SNARKtor: A Decentralized Protocol for Scaling SNARKs Verification in Blockchains | Telos Blockchain | World's Fastest EVM](https://www.telos.net/post/snarktor-a-decentralized-protocol-for- scaling-snarks-verification-in-blockchains) [oai_citation:8,The Convergence of Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Decentralized Systems: Part 2 | AdaPulse]( AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/the-convergence-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-and-decentralized-systems-part-2/) [oai_citation:9,ZkEVM explained: examining the future of zk rollups - LimeChain](https://limechain.tech/blog/zkevm-explained-the-future-of-zk-rollups/)

However, HyperFlux has adopted a new approach to overcome these challenges by integrating the research results and technologies accumulated to date. Specifically, the following factors make this possible: 1.

1. **Integration of state-of-the-art research and technology**: by combining state-of-the-art blockchain technology and algorithms, we were able to overcome the previous technical limitations [ [oai_citation:10,GitHub - Setheum-Labs/Setheum: Setheum: zk- SNARKs Enabled DAG Powered Blockchain for Light-speed Smart Contracts. Ready for hacking ](https://github.com/Setheum-Labs/Setheum) [oai_ citation:11,SNARKtor: A Decentralized Protocol for Scaling SNARKs Verification in Blockchains | Telos Blockchain | World's Fastest EVM](https:// www.telos.net/post/snarktor-a-decentralized-protocol-for-scaling-snarks-verification-in-blockchains)
2.**Strong Development Team and Community**: The collaboration between the expert team and the open source community enables rapid technology development and problem solving [ [oai_citation:12,The Sudden Rise of EVM-Compatible ZK Rollups]( https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/20/the-sudden-rise-of-evm-compatible-zk-rollups/)
3. **Using Autonomous Development Software**: Tools like OpenDevin streamline the development process and make it easier to implement complex technologies.
4. **Continuous Improvement and Testing**: Through continuous testing and feedback loops, we are improving the reliability and performance of our technology [ [oai_citation:13,The Convergence of Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Decentralized Systems: Part 2 | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/the-convergence-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-and-decentralized-systems-part-2 /) [oai_citation:14,ZkEVM explained: examining the future of zk rollups - LimeChain](https://limechain.tech/blog/zkevm-explained-the-future-of- zk-rollups/)

These factors enable HyperFlux to deliver performance and convenience that outperforms other blockchain projects and enables the next generation of blockchain technology.
