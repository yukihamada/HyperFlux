### Why is this feasible?

HyperFlux is able to achieve these goals because of the following innovations: 1.

1. **Proprietary BFT + DAG Algorithm**: Enables faster processing and finalization of transactions, resulting in higher throughput [ [oai_citation:1,GitHub - Setheum-Labs/Setheum: Setheum: zk-SNARKs Enabled DAG Powered Blockchain for Light-speed Smart Contracts. Ready for hacking](https://github.com/Setheum-Labs/Setheum) [oai_citation:2,SNARKtor : A Decentralized Protocol for Scaling SNARKs Verification in Blockchains | Telos Blockchain | World's Fastest EVM](https://www.telos.net/post/ snarktor-a-decentralized-protocol-for-scaling-snarks-verification-in-blockchains)
2. **zk-SNARKs technology**: provides a trusted blockchain environment with enhanced data privacy and security [ [oai_citation:3,Zero-knowledge rollups | ethereum.org](https:// ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/)
3. **Sharding technology**: effectively distributes network load and improves scalability [ [oai_citation:4,The Convergence of Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Decentralized Systems: Part 2 | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/the-convergence-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-and-decentralized-systems-part-2/) [oai_citation:5,ZkEVM explained: examining the future of zk rollups - LimeChain](https://limechain.tech/blog/zkevm-explained-the-future-of-zk-rollups/)
4. **EVM compatibility**: compatibility with the existing Ethereum ecosystem makes it easier for developers to use existing tools and libraries [ [oai_citation:6,The Sudden Rise of EVM-Compatible ZK Rollups](https ://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/20/the-sudden-rise-of-evm-compatible-zk-rollups/)
5. **Using Autonomous Development Software**: The advent of autonomous development software such as OpenDevin has greatly increased the efficiency of the development process and enabled the implementation of advanced technologies.

### Why this has never been done before.

Traditional blockchain projects have faced the so-called ‚Äútrilemma‚Äù of scalability, security, and decentralization. Many projects focused on some of these elements, making it very difficult to achieve all of them simultaneously. For example, combining EVM compatibility with zk-SNARKs was technically very complex and required a lot of resources and time [ [oai_citation:7,SNARKtor: A Decentralized Protocol for Scaling SNARKs Verification in Blockchains | Telos Blockchain | World's Fastest EVM](https://www.telos.net/post/snarktor-a-decentralized-protocol-for- scaling-snarks-verification-in-blockchains) [oai_citation:8,The Convergence of Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Decentralized Systems: Part 2 | AdaPulse]( AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/the-convergence-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-and-decentralized-systems-part-2/) [oai_citation:9,ZkEVM explained: examining the future of zk rollups - LimeChain](https://limechain.tech/blog/zkevm-explained-the-future-of-zk-rollups/)

However, HyperFlux has adopted a new approach to overcome these challenges by integrating the research results and technologies accumulated to date. Specifically, the following factors make this possible: 1.

1. **Integration of state-of-the-art research and technology**: by combining state-of-the-art blockchain technology and algorithms, we were able to overcome the previous technical limitations [ [oai_citation:10,GitHub - Setheum-Labs/Setheum: Setheum: zk- SNARKs Enabled DAG Powered Blockchain for Light-speed Smart Contracts. Ready for hacking ](https://github.com/Setheum-Labs/Setheum) [oai_ citation:11,SNARKtor: A Decentralized Protocol for Scaling SNARKs Verification in Blockchains | Telos Blockchain | World's Fastest EVM](https:// www.telos.net/post/snarktor-a-decentralized-protocol-for-scaling-snarks-verification-in-blockchains)
2.**Strong Development Team and Community**: The collaboration between the expert team and the open source community enables rapid technology development and problem solving [ [oai_citation:12,The Sudden Rise of EVM-Compatible ZK Rollups]( https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/07/20/the-sudden-rise-of-evm-compatible-zk-rollups/)
3. **Using Autonomous Development Software**: Tools like OpenDevin streamline the development process and make it easier to implement complex technologies.
4. **Continuous Improvement and Testing**: Through continuous testing and feedback loops, we are improving the reliability and performance of our technology [ [oai_citation:13,The Convergence of Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Decentralized Systems: Part 2 | AdaPulse](https://adapulse.io/the-convergence-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-and-decentralized-systems-part-2 /) [oai_citation:14,ZkEVM explained: examining the future of zk rollups - LimeChain](https://limechain.tech/blog/zkevm-explained-the-future-of- zk-rollups/)

These factors enable HyperFlux to deliver performance and convenience that outperforms other blockchain projects and enables the next generation of blockchain technology.
